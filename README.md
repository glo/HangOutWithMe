# "Hang Out With Me" mobile web app, developed by Gloria Lin.

This is my first Ruby on Rails application. I've decided to build a mobile web app tentatively named "Hang Out With Me" as a way of learning web development. The idea is to allow you to hang out with friends without much planning, so instead of planning and committing to hanging out with a particular friend at some point in the future, you look around on HOWM to see who else wants to do something that same day.

Initially this may be where I learn the Ruby on Rails Tutorial (http://railstutorial.org by Michael Hartl (http://michaelhartl.com/) and put my code.
